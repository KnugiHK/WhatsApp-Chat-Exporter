A customizable Android and iPhone Whatsapp database parser that will give you the history of your Whatsapp conversations in HTML and JSON. Inspired by [Telegram Chat Export Tool](https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more).  
> [!TIP]
> If you plan to uninstall WhatsApp or delete your WhatsApp account, please make a backup of your WhatsApp database. You may want to use this exporter again on the same database in the future as the exporter develops.

# Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Usage in README may be removed in the future. Check the usage in [Wiki](https://github.com/KnugiHK/Whatsapp-Chat-Exporter/wiki)

First, install the exporter by:
```shell
pip install whatsapp-chat-exporter
pip install whatsapp-chat-exporter[android_backup]  :; # Optional, if you want it to support decrypting Android WhatsApp backup.
```
Then, create a working directory in somewhere you want
```shell
mkdir working_wts
cd working_wts
```

> [!TIP]
> macOS users should grant *Full Disk Access* to Terminal in the *Security & Privacy* settings before using the exporter.

## Working with Android
### Unencrypted WhatsApp database
Extract the WhatsApp database with whatever means, one possible means is to use the [WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor). Note that the extractor only works on Android 4.0 to 13.

After you obtain your WhatsApp database, copy the WhatsApp database and media folder to the working directory. The database is called msgstore.db. If you also want the name of your contacts, get the contact database, which is called wa.db. And copy the WhatsApp (Media) directory from your phone directly.

And now, you should have something like this in the working directory.

![Android folder structure](imgs/android_structure.png)
#### Extracting
Simply invoke the following command from shell.
```sh
wtsexporter -a
```
#### Enriching Contact from vCard
The default WhatsApp contact database typically contained contact names extracted from your phone, which the exporter used to map your chats. However, in some reported cases, the database may have never been populated. In such case, you can export your contacts to a vCard file from your phone or a cloud provider like Google Contacts. Then, install the necessary dependency and run the following command from the shell:
```sh
pip install whatsapp-chat-exporter["vcards"]
wtsexporter -a --enrich-from-vcard contacts.vcf --default-country-code 852
```

### Encrypted Android WhatsApp Backup
In order to support the decryption, install pycryptodome if it is not installed
```sh
pip install pycryptodome # Or 
pip install whatsapp-chat-exporter["android_backup"] # install along with this software
```

> [!TIP]
> Crypt15 is now the easiest way to decrypt a backup. If you have the 32 bytes hex key generated when you enable End-to-End encrypted backup, you can use it to decrypt the backup. If you do not have the 32 bytes hex key, you can still use the key file extracted just like extacting key file for Crypt12 and Crypt14 to decrypt the backup.

#### Crypt12 or Crypt14
You will need the decryption key file from your phone. If you have root access, you can find it as `/data/data/com.whatsapp/files/key`. Otherwise, if you used WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor before, it will appear in the WhatsApp backup directory as `WhatsApp/Databases/.nomedia`.

Place the decryption key file (key) and the encrypted WhatsApp Backup (msgstore.db.crypt14) in the working directory. If you also want the name of your contacts, get the contact database, which is called wa.db. And copy the WhatsApp (Media) directory from your phone directly.

And now, you should have something like this in the working directory.

![Android folder structure with WhatsApp Backup](imgs/android_structure_backup.png)
#### Extracting
Simply invoke the following command from shell.
```sh
wtsexporter -a -k key -b msgstore.db.crypt14
```

#### Crypt15 (End-to-End Encrypted Backup)
To support Crypt15 backup, install javaobj-py3 if it is not installed
```sh
pip install javaobj-py3 # Or 
pip install whatsapp-chat-exporter["crypt15"] # install along with this software
```
Before proceeding with this method, you must first create an end-to-end encrypted backup. For detailed instructions, refer to [WhatsApp's help center](https://faq.whatsapp.com/490592613091019).

Once you have copied the backup files to your computer, place the encrypted WhatsApp backup file (msgstore.db.crypt15) into the working directory. If you also wish to include your contacts' names, obtain the contact database file, named wa.db. Additionally, copy the WhatsApp Media folder directly from your phone.

If you do not have the 32 bytes hex key (64 hexdigits), place the decryption key file (encrypted_backup.key) extracted from Android. If you gave the 32 bytes hex key, simply put the key in the shell.

Now, you should have something like this in the working directory (if you do not have 32 bytes hex key).

![Android folder structure with WhatsApp Crypt15 Backup](imgs/android_structure_backup_crypt15.png)
##### Extracting
If you do not have 32 bytes hex key but have the key file available, simply invoke the following command from shell.
```sh
wtsexporter -a -k encrypted_backup.key -b msgstore.db.crypt15
```
If you have the 32 bytes hex key, simply put the hex key in the -k option and invoke the command from shell like this:
```sh
wtsexporter -a -k 133735053b5204b08e5c3823423399aa30ff061435ab89bc4e6713969cda1337 -b msgstore.db.crypt15
```

## Working with iOS/iPadOS (iPhone or iPad)
Do an iPhone/iPad Backup with iTunes/Finder first.
* iPhone backup on Mac: https://support.apple.com/HT211229
* iPhone backup on Windows: https://support.apple.com/HT212156
* iPad backup: https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a74df05xx/ipados
### Encrypted iOS/iPadOS Backup
> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on unencrypted iOS/iPadOS backup, skip this.

If you want to work on an encrypted iOS/iPadOS Backup, you should install iphone_backup_decrypt from [KnugiHK/iphone_backup_decrypt](https://github.com/KnugiHK/iphone_backup_decrypt) before you run the extract_iphone_media.py.
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/KnugiHK/iphone_backup_decrypt
```
> [!NOTE]
> You will need to disable the built-in end-to-end encryption for WhatsApp backups. See [WhatsApp's FAQ](https://faq.whatsapp.com/490592613091019#turn-off-end-to-end-encrypted-backup) for how to do it.
### Extracting
To extract messages from iOS/iPadOS backups, run the following command in the shell, making sure to replace the username and device ID with the correct values. Keep in mind that there are at least two possible paths for the backups on Windows.
#### Windows
```powershell
# Possible path one
wtsexporter -i -b "C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\[device id]"

# Possible path two
wtsexporter -i -b "C:\Users\[Username]\Apple\MobileSync\Backup\[device id]"
```

#### Mac
```sh
wtsexporter -i -b ~/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup/[device id]
```

## Results
After extracting, you will get these:
#### Private Message

#### Group Message

## More options
Invoke the wtsexporter with --help option will show you all options available.

                        Exclude chats that match the supplied phone number
  --dont-filter-empty   By default, the exporter will not render chats with no valid message. Setting this flag will

Incremental Merging:
  --incremental-merge   Performs an incremental merge of two exports. Requires setting both --source-
                        dir and --target-dir. The chats (JSON files only) and media from the source
                        directory will be merged into the target directory. No chat messages or media
                        will be deleted from the target directory; only new chat messages and media
                        will be added to it. This enables chat messages and media to be deleted from
                        the device to free up space, while ensuring they are preserved in the exported
                        backups.
  --source-dir SOURCE_DIR
                        Sets the source directory. Used for performing incremental merges.
  --target-dir TARGET_DIR
                        Sets the target directory. Used for performing incremental merges.

  --assume-first-as-me  Assume the first message in a chat as sent by me (must be used together with -e)
  --business            Use Whatsapp Business default files (iOS only)
  --decrypt-chunk-size DECRYPT_CHUNK_SIZE
                        Specify the chunk size for decrypting iOS backup, which may affect the decryption speed.
  --max-bruteforce-worker MAX_BRUTEFORCE_WORKER
                        Specify the maximum number of worker for bruteforce decryption.
